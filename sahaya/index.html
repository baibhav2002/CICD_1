									<h2>Transforming Lives: Impacting Communities Through Poverty Alleviation"</h2>
									<p>Facts about Indian Poverty</p>
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p>India, a nation renowned for its cultural diversity and historical significance, grapples with the persistent challenge of poverty. With a population of over 1.3 billion people, India is home to one of the largest populations of impoverished individuals in the world. Despite considerable economic growth and development in recent years, a significant portion of its populace still faces poverty's harsh realities.

									According to various reports and statistics, a substantial percentage of India's population lives below the poverty line, struggling to access basic necessities such as food, clean water, healthcare, and education. The divide between urban and rural areas accentuates these disparities, with rural regions often bearing the brunt of inadequate infrastructure and limited opportunities.</p>
								<p> Targeted welfare programs are important tools in poverty alleviation. Direct cash transfers, food assistance, and housing programs can provide a safety net for vulnerable populations and help them meet their basic needs.</p>
